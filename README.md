# AP Computer Science A (Java)

*American School in Japan – High School*

## Course Context

This repository contains my programming assignments from **AP Computer Science A** at the American School in Japan, **2019–2020 academic year**.
The course introduced object-oriented programming in Java, fundamental algorithms, and problem-solving strategies aligned with the AP College Board curriculum.
It served as my first formal programming course and laid the foundation for advanced university-level computer science classes in algorithms, data structures, and software engineering.

**Tech Stack:** Java (JDK) · Java Swing · Standard Java Libraries

## How to Run

Compile and run using the Java compiler or your preferred IDE:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

(Some labs may have differently named main classes.)

## What to Look For

* Consistent use of object-oriented design principles.
* Clean, readable code with comments explaining logic.
* Progressive complexity from introductory exercises to full game simulations.

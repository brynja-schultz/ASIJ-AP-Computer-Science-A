# ASIJ — AP Computer Science A (Java) Projects

This repository contains programming assignments and projects I completed while attending the **American School in Japan** in high school as part of the AP Computer Science A course.
These exercises cover a range of foundational and intermediate Java programming concepts, with a focus on object-oriented design, algorithms, and problem-solving.
Completing these projects during high school gave me early exposure to structured software development and reinforced my interest in pursuing computer science at a higher academic level.

## Skills Developed

Through these projects, I gained:

* **Strong foundation in Java programming** — syntax, control structures, object-oriented principles.
* **Algorithmic problem-solving skills** — sorting, searching, recursion, and data structure manipulation.
* **Experience with core data structures** — arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
* **Software design practices** — modular code, encapsulation, and interface/abstract class design.
* **Error handling and robustness** — exception handling and input validation.
* **File I/O** — reading and writing structured and unstructured data.
* **Basic GUI development** — building interactive programs using Java Swing.
* **Collaboration readiness** — following structured assignments, naming conventions, and documentation standards.

## How to Run

Projects are written in Java and can be compiled/run using the `javac` and `java` commands, or opened in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

Example:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## What to Look For

* Correct Java syntax and use of object-oriented principles (classes, methods, encapsulation)
* Application of algorithms, data structures, and control structures to solve problems
* Clear, commented code reflecting AP-level computer science practices
